# Hotel Revenue Analysis Project
This project is based on hotel properties from different countries owned by the same company. The data was collected from an excel spreadsheet starting from 2018 to 2020. The aim of this project is to analyze the growth of hotel revenue for each year, and also try to find out if the parking lot size should be increased based on the trend we are getting from the data on our guests with personal cars. Lastly, we will explore any trends we can see in the data.

# Data Sources
The data for this analysis was collected from an excel spreadsheet containing information on hotel properties owned by the company. The spreadsheet contains data for each year from 2018 to 2020, including information on hotel revenue, number of guests, and parking lot size.

# Methods and Techniques
We will use basic statistical analysis to calculate the average revenue and growth rate for each year. We will also use data visualization techniques to create charts and graphs that show the trend in hotel revenue over time. For the analysis of parking lot size, we will use basic statistical analysis to calculate the correlation between the number of guests with personal cars and the parking lot size. Lastly, we will use data visualization techniques to explore any trends we can see in the data.

#Limitations and Future Work
Analysis is limited to the data provided in the excel spreadsheet and may not be representative of all hotel properties owned by the company. Additionally, the analysis of parking lot size does not take into account other factors such as the availability of public transportation or the popularity of ride-sharing services. Future work could involve collecting more data on these factors and conducting more detailed analysis to make more accurate recommendations.

# Installation and Usage
To use this project, you will need to have Power BI installed on your computer. Once you have cloned the repository, you can run the  "HotelProperties.pbix" to perform the analysis and generate the visualizations.
